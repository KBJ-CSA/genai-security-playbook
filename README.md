# 🛡️ LLM Security Testing

**An ongoing initiative to break, test, and secure GenAI systems — turning real attack research into practical defenses.**

---

## 🎯 About This Repository
This repository documents practical approaches to **LLM security testing**, including prompt injection research, RAG threat modeling, guardrail evaluation, and secure architecture patterns.

It is designed as a living resource for:
- Security engineers
- AI builders
- Red teamers
- Researchers

As the GenAI threat landscape evolves, new playbooks, payloads, and threat models will continue to be added.

---

## 📌 Key Areas Covered
- Prompt Injection & Jailbreak Techniques  
- Payload Library (Real-world patterns)  
- LLM Security Testing Checklist  
- Security Architecture & Trust Boundaries  
- **MAESTRO Threat Modeling for LLMs**  
- Case Studies & Attack Path Analysis  
- Curated Learning Resources  

---

## 🚀 Goal
Make LLM security **practical, repeatable, and engineering-driven** — not just theoretical.


## 🧪 Scope

The playbooks focus on security testing for:

- LLM chat applications  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems  
- Tool-integrated AI agents  
- Copilots and assistants

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Provide a repeatable GenAI security testing framework  
- Demonstrate practical red teaming techniques  
- Share lessons learned from assessments  

---

## ⚠️ Responsible Use

All techniques are intended for:

- Authorized security testing  
- Research and education  

Do not use these techniques on systems without permission.
