# Mapping MAESTRO to LLM Attack Taxonomy

| MAESTRO Category | Attack Taxonomy Area | Example Attacks |
|------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Manipulation | Prompt Attacks | Prompt injection, jailbreaks |
| Manipulation | Context Attacks | Memory poisoning, indirect injection |
| Access | Output Risks | Data leakage |
| Access | Retrieval Attacks | Unauthorized document access |
| Execution | System Attacks | Tool exploitation, agent chain attacks |
| Supply Chain | Retrieval Attacks | RAG poisoning, vector DB manipulation |
| Trust | Output Risks | Hallucinations, policy misrepresentation |
| Resilience | System Attacks | Prompt flooding, resource exhaustion |
| Oversight | All categories | Lack of logging and detection |

## How to Use This Mapping

1. Start with attack taxonomy to identify threats  
2. Classify them under MAESTRO categories  
3. Apply controls aligned to category  
4. Track coverage gaps
